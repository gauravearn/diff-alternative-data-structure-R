# diff-alternative-data-structure-R
I read this post today and they mentioned the diff which i have used mostly in R but i want to put this git just to show that you can also do this from a data structure point of view and which you can also use. I also put multiple examples to show how this can be applied to the datascience and variosu datastructures.
